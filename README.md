# noted
Initial work on my own noted note management app. It's written in javasript with
nodejs as a backend and mongodb as database.

# Tools
* [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) - backend
* [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/) - template
* [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/) - database
* [passport](http://passportjs.org/) - user authentication
* [jquery](http://jquery.com/) - ajax 


# Basic architecture
'Nodejs' is used as backend with 'express.js' routing for requests. The data is
served as json to the frontend which uses 'Passport' for user authentication and
'jquery' for ajax requests to the backend. On the backend 'mongodb' provides
persistent storage for user credentials and task items.

# Install
* Install mongodb from package-manager
* ```npm install -g express express-generator mongodb passport jquery --save```

## or run
```npm install```

# Usage

This README will grow with the app being developed.
